Multi-node inference for [RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4) across 2 DGX Sparks using vLLM with TP2+EP+MTP3.

Based on [getrefined/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-vLLM-DGX-Spark](https://github.com/getrefined/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-vLLM-DGX-Spark).

All numbers in **KV cache budget** and **Default runtime** below were read from the running
server (`docker logs vllm-fn`, `docker inspect vllm-fn`) — they are measurements, not estimates.
That container runs `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.835`, i.e. the value `.env` / `.env.sample` ship today.

## Prerequisites

- 2 DGX Spark nodes (GB10, 128 GB unified memory, sm_121) connected via ConnectX RoCE/IB
- Passwordless SSH between nodes
- Docker on both nodes
- ~126 GiB free **on each node** for the checkpoint. By default both nodes keep their own copy in `~/.cache/huggingface`; `start.sh` rsyncs the worker copy from the head once. Enable [NFS weight sharing](#nfs-weight-sharing-optional) to skip the worker copy entirely.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Edit .env (set IPs, interface, IB HCA, etc.)
cp .env.sample .env
vim .env

# 2. Download weights onto the head
./download.sh
#    ./download.sh --fp8    # official FP8 instead
#    ABLIT=1 ./download.sh  # gated Keys house QSA L3-47 (HF_TOKEN + accept terms)

# 3. Sync to worker, apply patches, launch (NVFP4)
./start.sh --no-download
#    or ./start.sh       if you want start.sh to download as well
#    or ./start.sh --nfs to share the head cache over NFS instead of rsyncing
#    or ABLIT=1 ./start.sh --no-download

#    Optional — official FP8 instead of NVFP4 (see below):
#    ./download.sh --fp8 && ./start-fp8.sh --no-download

# 4. Confirm the KV cache pool that vLLM actually allocated (~11 min after launch)
docker logs vllm-fn 2>&1 | grep -E "Available KV cache memory|GPU KV cache size"
```

`./start.sh` and `./start-fp8.sh` both launch containers named **`vllm-fn`** on the same port — stop first with `./stop.sh` before switching checkpoints.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-download` | Skip HF download (weights already in the head cache) |
| `--no-launch` | Download + distribute weights only, don't start the server |
| `--launch` | Skip download + sync; apply patches and launch (weights already on both nodes) |
| `--nfs` | Distribute weights over NFS instead of rsync (see [below](#nfs-weight-sharing-optional)) |
| `--no-nfs` | Force rsync distribution even if `NFS_SHARE=true` in `.env` |
| `ABLIT=1` | Env/`.env` flag: serve the gated Keys house QSA L3–47 checkpoint (see [Abliterated checkpoint](#abliterated-checkpoint-ablit)) |

## Official FP8 checkpoint (optional)

Same two-Spark launch as `./start.sh`, but serve
[`Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8)
instead of NVFP4. Cluster IPs, TP/EP/MTP, image and ports still come from `.env`.
Context is native 262K with YaRN off — FP8 weights leave too little KV for 1M
on this kit. **Available KV cache is around 500k tokens**, not the 3.65M of
the nvidia NVFP4 checkpoint with `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`.

```bash
./download.sh --fp8
./stop.sh                          # start.sh and start-fp8.sh share vllm-fn
./start-fp8.sh --no-download
# API name: qwen3.8-flash-next-fp8
```

This is **not** `FP8_DENSE=true` (hybrid NVFP4 experts + FP8 dense projections)
and **not** fp8 KV on stock NVFP4. `ABLIT=1` is ignored when `./start-fp8.sh`
sets `OVERRIDE_MODEL_ID`.

## What Happens

1. **Download** — `./download.sh` pulls `MODEL_ID` from `.env` (stock NVFP4) to the **head** HF cache (`./download.sh --fp8` for official FP8; `ABLIT=1 ./download.sh` for the gated Keys house checkpoint).
2. **Distribute** — by default `rsync` copies the checkpoint into the worker's own `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` over the ConnectX link, skipped when the worker already has it. With `NFS_SHARE=true` / `--nfs` this is replaced by the [NFS share](#nfs-weight-sharing-optional).
3. **Image sync** — ensures `vllm/vllm-openai:qwen38-flash-next` is on both nodes
4. **PLE patch** — extracts `ple_layer.py` from the image and patches it into `files/ple_layer_patched.py` (no image rebuild; bind-mounted at runtime)
5. **MXFP8 patch** — extracts `modelopt.py` and patches it into `files/modelopt_patched.py`, routing the MXFP8 shapes FlashInfer's `mm_mxfp8` cannot run to the BF16 emulation kernel (also bind-mounted)
6. **Preflight + overlays** — refuses to launch if another process holds a GPU on either node
   (`REQUIRE_IDLE_GPU=false` to override); prepares the `FP8_DENSE` / `QSA_PROFILE` bind-mounts
7. **Launch** — worker (rank 1) starts first, then head (rank 0) serves on `:8888`. Both launch
   scripts render the same `VLLM_ARGS` array (`EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` really is appended last now;
   `ENABLE_EXPERT_PARALLEL=false` and `MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS=0` are honored). The head's
   rendered script is kept as `.last_head_launch.sh` for inspection.

> **Not done for you: dropping page caches.** `start.sh` needs no root and does
> **not** drop page caches. Do it yourself on **both** nodes before a launch —

>
> ```bash
> sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
> ```

Both containers are named **`vllm-fn`** (head and worker); `./stop.sh` removes both.

## NFS weight sharing (optional)

**Off by default.** By default each node keeps its own copy of the checkpoint in
`~/.cache/huggingface`, and `start.sh` rsyncs the worker's copy from the head once (subsequent
launches detect it and skip the transfer). That costs ~126 GiB on the worker and one long copy the
first time, but the worker is then self-sufficient.

Turn NFS sharing on to skip the worker copy entirely — the head exports its HF cache and the worker
mounts it read-only:

```bash
NFS_SHARE=true ./start.sh --launch     # or set NFS_SHARE=true in .env
./start.sh --nfs                       # same, per-run flag
./start.sh --no-nfs                    # force rsync even with NFS_SHARE=true in .env
```

A privileged `vllm-fn-nfs` container on the head exports `$HF_CACHE_DIR` over NFSv4 on the ConnectX
address (`NFS_SERVER_IP`, auto-detected from `IFACE` — do **not** use the `10.0.0.1` loopback
alias). The worker Docker volume `vllm-fn-hf` mounts it read-only at `/root/.cache/huggingface`.

| | rsync (default) | `NFS_SHARE=true` |
|---|---|---|
| Worker disk | ~126 GiB | none |
| First launch | one full copy, then free | no copy |
| Every cold start | reads local disk | streams ~126 GiB over ConnectX |
| Head must stay up | only to launch | **for the whole serving run** |
| Failure mode | worker cache goes stale silently | share dies → worker loses its weights |

Prefer NFS when worker disk is tight or you re-pull checkpoints often; prefer the default when you
want the two nodes decoupled. Switching checkpoints is where NFS earns its keep — no re-sync.

Notes when it is on:

- `./stop.sh` leaves the share up so the next `--launch` does not rebuild it; `./stop.sh --nfs`
  tears it down and removes the worker volume. Kernel NFS in Docker can ignore SIGKILL when
  rpcbind is in D-state, so that path has a 15 s timeout and reports if the container survives.
- **Do not stop `vllm-fn-nfs` while vLLM is loading or running** — the worker reads shards from it.
- `./check-weights.sh` follows `NFS_SHARE`: it verifies the worker's local copy by default, or the
  NFS volume when sharing is on.

## Abliterated checkpoint (`ABLIT`)

`ABLIT=0` serves stock `MODEL_ID` (nvidia NVFP4 by default). `ABLIT=1` serves the gated
Keys checkpoint
[`drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-dual-ablit-house-qsa-L3-47`](https://huggingface.co/drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-dual-ablit-house-qsa-L3-47):
the same nvidia dual-Spark NVFP4 layout with a house residual-writer projection on 12 QSA
`self_attn.o_proj` tensors at layers 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43 and 47. GDN
`out_proj`, routed experts, MTP, PLE, vision and the chat template stay stock. It is valid
**only** on this recipe — do not use it with the single-Spark MXFP8 tree, official FP8, or
`FP8_DENSE=true`. `./start-fp8.sh` and `FP8_DENSE=true` still win if you set them, and
`ABLIT=1` is ignored for checkpoint selection in those cases.

That Hugging Face repo is **gated**. `ABLIT=1 ./download.sh` **fails immediately** if
`HF_TOKEN` is unset and prints the steps below. Set the token, **Accept the terms on that
page**, then download the **full** snapshot (same nvidia NVFP4 size class, ~133 GiB). Stock
and ablit caches sit side by side; flipping `ABLIT` is the only switch. `start.sh` rsyncs
whichever checkpoint `ABLIT` selected onto the worker (or shares it over NFS). An interrupted
download is not treated as ready — rerun `ABLIT=1 ./download.sh` to resume.

```bash
# 1. In .env: set ABLIT=1 and uncomment HF_TOKEN (or export both for this shell)
# 2. In the browser, accept the terms on:
#    https://huggingface.co/drowzeys/keys-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-dual-ablit-house-qsa-L3-47
HF_TOKEN=hf_... ABLIT=1 ./download.sh
ABLIT=1 ./start.sh
```

`HF_TOKEN` is required for `ABLIT=1`. A 403 means access has not been granted yet —
**Accept the terms on that page**, then retry with `HF_TOKEN` set. Unlike most knobs in
this launcher, `ABLIT` and `HF_TOKEN` honour the environment over `.env`, so
`ABLIT=1 ./start.sh` works even when `.env` still has `ABLIT=0`. Switch back with
`ABLIT=0 ./start.sh` (stock `MODEL_ID`; no re-download if that cache is already complete).

**The gate is a binding agreement, not a download button.** The checkpoint ships its own
responsible-use terms, and requesting access means accepting them. In summary: you must be
18 or older; you are accountable for harm from generated recipes or knowledge; and the
terms prohibit sexual content involving minors, material promoting self-harm or suicide,
harassment, doxxing or fraud targeting real people, anything illegal in your jurisdiction,
and any use barred by the NVIDIA Open Model License or the Qwen Community License 1.0.
The weights are provided as-is with no warranty and inherit their licence from
`nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`. Read the repo's own terms before requesting access —
this paragraph is a summary, and those terms are what bind.

Safety refusals are removed in this checkpoint, which moves the guardrails onto you:
filtering, human review and access control are yours to supply. That matters more here
than on stock, because `start.sh` binds the server to `0.0.0.0` — anything that can reach
the port can reach an unfiltered model.

The abliteration splice is by **Keys (drowzeys)**, a house projection on NVIDIA stock
(axis recovered per QSA layer from Dealign, not a Dealign weight dump). See the
checkpoint's model card, and [Credits](#credits) below.

The Keys `config.json` mislabels MTP routed experts as `FP8_PB_WO`; nvidia and
this snapshot's own `hf_quant_config.json` record `FP8_BLOCK_SCALES` (same 128×128
tensors). `start.sh` rewrites that overlay the same way it adds the `mtp.layers.48`
alias, so MTP 3 still works.

## KV cache budget

Measured on the running container at the shipped defaults (`KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`,
`GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.835`, `MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144`, MTP3, TP2, nvidia NVFP4 checkpoint).
Official FP8 (`./start-fp8.sh`) is a different checkpoint — see
[Official FP8 checkpoint](#official-fp8-checkpoint-optional); its available KV
cache is around **500k tokens**, not the 3.65M below.

```
[gpu_worker.py:693]   Available KV cache memory: 32.02 GiB
[kv_cache_utils.py]   GPU KV cache size: 3,652,200 tokens,
                      Maximum concurrency for 262,144 tokens per request: 13.93x
```

**FP8 vs bf16 on this kit**, same GMU, same checkpoint, KV dtype the only change:

| | `auto` (bf16) | **`fp8`** (default) |
|---|---|---|
| KV pool | 31.7 GiB | 32.02 GiB |
| Cache size | 2,131,159 tok | **3,652,200 tok** |
| Concurrency at 262,144 | 8.13× | **13.93×** |
| Tokens per GiB | 67,229 | **114,060** (1.70×) |
| Reasoning + needle suite | 12/12 | 12/12 (no regressions) |

1.70×, not 2×, because the QSA indexer and compressor stay BF16 — only the main K/V halve.
A 1M-token context now fits 3.5× over. Weights (68.52 GiB/GPU), not KV, are the binding
constraint on this box.

**Per-GPU memory accounting (GB10, per node — from `gpu_worker.py:919`):**

| Line | GiB |
|------|-----|
| Total memory visible to CUDA | 121.69 |
| Free at startup | 108.79 |
| Budgeted at GMU 0.835 | 101.61 |
| Weights (`model_runner.py:407`) | 64.46 |
| Weights + non-torch | 68.52 |
| Peak activation | 1.07 |
| CUDA graphs | 0.54 |
| **KV cache** | **32.02** |

vLLM reports headroom for `--kv-cache-memory=41360080896` (38.52 GiB) if you want to push
`GMU` higher.

The nvidia checkpoint is 124 GiB on disk / 11 shards (NVFP4 experts, FP8 PLE n-gram table ≈ 51 GB,
bf16 attention/dense/vision). With EP + TP the per-GPU weight footprint lands at 64.46 GiB —
roughly experts 34 GB + PLE shard ~25 GB + bf16 dense ~10 GB. Weights, not KV, are what eats
this box, and that is more true at fp8 than it was at bf16.

**Why the cache is so cheap:** of the 48 layers only every 4th is `full_attention`
(`full_attention_interval: 4`) → **12 KV-bearing layers + 1 MTP draft layer = 13**. The other
36 are Gated-DeltaNet linear attention: constant-size recurrent state per *request*, not per
token. With `num_key_value_heads: 2`, `head_dim: 256`:

```
13 layers × 2 (K,V) × 2 kv_heads × 256 × 2 B (bf16) = 26,624 B/token  (= 13,312 B/GPU at TP2)
13 layers × 2 (K,V) × 2 kv_heads × 256 × 1 B (fp8)  = 13,312 B/token  (=  6,656 B/GPU at TP2)
```

At fp8 vLLM reports 32.02 GiB / 3,652,200 tokens = **9,418 B/token/GPU**, ~41% above the pure
attention figure (bf16 was 15,192 B/token/GPU, ~14% above). The overhead grows in relative
terms precisely because the attention half halved while the rest did not: the 36 GDN layers'
state and the sparse-attention (QSA) index state stay BF16, which is why the pool expands
1.70× rather than 2×. Rounding is forced: vLLM sets the **attention block size to 1600 tokens**
so the attention page size matches (and never falls below) the Mamba/GDN page size.

| Config | KV pool | Cache tokens | 1M-ctx concurrency | 262K-ctx concurrency |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **fp8 KV, GMU 0.835 — measured (shipped default, running now)** | **32.02 GiB** | **3,652,200** | **3.65×** | **13.93×** |
| bf16 KV, GMU 0.835 — measured (same container, dtype only change) | 31.70 GiB | 2,131,159 | 2.13× | 8.13× |
| fp8 KV, `--kv-cache-memory=41360080896` (38.52 GiB, log-suggested) | 38.52 GiB | ≈ 4.39M | ≈ 4.4× | ≈ 16.8× |
| bf16 KV, GMU 0.85 — measured (older container, older checkpoint) | 36.35 GiB | 2,572,755 | 2.57× | 9.8× |

There **is** headroom at 0.835 — the startup log says so explicitly:

```
Replace gpu_memory_utilization config with `--kv-cache-memory=33651431445` (31.34 GiB) to fit
into requested memory, or `--kv-cache-memory=41360080896` (38.52 GiB) to fully utilize gpu memory.
Current kv cache memory in use is 32.02 GiB.
```

So ~6.5 GiB (≈ +740k fp8 cache tokens) is sitting unused; the 31.34 GiB "strict fit" figure is
just vLLM recomputing the 0.835 budget from its own profiling deltas — the pool ended up
~0.7 GiB larger than that. At 13.93× against `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` there is little reason to chase
it: the scheduler admits fewer requests than the cache can already hold.

> **The default `.env` is oversubscribed.** `MAX_MODEL_LEN=1000000` × `MAX_NUM_SEQS=8` asks for
> 8M cache tokens; the pool holds 2.48M. That is fine — vLLM preempts/evicts rather than
> OOM — but only ~2 concurrent 1M requests stay resident, and the 3rd+ gets preempted and

**Live occupancy / re-check after any change:**

```bash
docker logs vllm-fn 2>&1 | grep -E "Available KV cache|GPU KV cache size|Free memory on device"
curl -s localhost:8888/metrics | grep -i "kv_cache_usage\|preemption"
```

vLLM also prints its own arithmetic on startup — the `Free memory on device` line suggests exact
`--kv-cache-memory=<bytes>` values (quoted above). `start.sh` always emits
`--gpu-memory-utilization` (and validates it as required), so prefer `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` for
headroom control; `EXTRA_VLLM_ARGS` is appended last if you want `--kv-cache-memory`. Rough rule
of thumb for extrapolating: **1 GiB of KV pool ≈ 71–74K tokens ≈ +0.07× at 1M ctx** — from the
measured 15,192 B/token, and from the 0.835 → 0.85 delta (+1.24 GiB → +91,331 tokens). Block/page
rounding in the hybrid allocator means it is ±5%, not exact.

As measured from the running container (`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.835`, the shipped default —
see [KV cache budget](#kv-cache-budget) for what that buys in tokens).

Container: `vllm/vllm-openai:qwen38-flash-next` (`sha256:d464f3b4…`, ~20.6 GB, NVIDIA dev build),

Container runs as root — the mount target must be `/root`, or offline HF lookups fail.

## FP8-dense hybrid checkpoint (`FP8_DENSE=true`)

The routed experts are the only NVFP4 tensors in `RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`; every dense
projection (GDN in/out, attention q/k/v/o, both HyperConnections per layer, shared experts, lm_head —
≈9.1 GiB bf16) is streamed from LPDDR5x on every decode step and is ~6.9 of the ≈9.2 GiB a step
reads per GPU. (Qwen's official `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8` does **not** help here: it keeps exactly
the same dense tensors in bf16 and only makes the experts FP8, i.e. *more* bytes per step.)

`files/fp8dense/` builds a hybrid checkpoint on the head, CPU-only, in ~2 minutes and ~1 GB RAM:

```bash
./files/fp8dense/build.sh        # -> ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--MiaAI-Lab--Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-FP8dense
# then in .env:
FP8_DENSE=true
./start.sh --launch
```

- Experts / PLE shards are hard-linked (no extra disk); only the 4 bf16 shards are rewritten (11.8 GB).
- 591 dense linears become FP8 E4M3 with **per-output-channel** weight scales and dynamic per-token
  activation quantization at runtime (no calibration set needed, no block-size constraints, so the
  rank-320 HyperConnection projections quantize too). Relative RMSE of the dequantized weights is
  ≈2.6 % per tensor (the E4M3 rounding floor); GSM8K/AIME re-evaluation is still owed.
- Kept bf16 on purpose: embeddings, router gates, shared-expert gate, QSA indexer projection, GDN
  `in_proj_a/b`, conv1d, norms, PLE projections, the MTP layer, vision tower.
- The checkpoint is a ModelOpt `MIXED_PRECISION` config (`quantized_layers` per tensor). vLLM's
  loader needs four bind-mounted patch files (`files/overlay/*.py`, generated from the image's own
  sources by `apply_patches.py`, diffs alongside): the mixed config learns to dispatch
  `FP8_PER_CHANNEL_PER_TOKEN`, and the HyperConnection / lm_head modules stop hard-coding
  `quant_config=None`. `start.sh` mounts them on both nodes when `FP8_DENSE=true`.
- Expected effect (analytical, §3.1 of the report): ≈9.2 → ≈5.7 GiB per decode step, i.e. roughly
  1.5× batch-1 tok/s at equal MTP acceptance. **Not yet measured on GPU** (both Sparks were busy with
  another deployment when this was built) — run the §6 benchmark from the report before trusting it,
  and watch the first launch for `Selected CutlassFP8ScaledMMLinearKernel` in the log.

## QSA launch profiles (`QSA_PROFILE`)

The 12 full-attention layers run the model's own Triton sparse-attention kernels, whose tile tables
were tuned on GB300 (160 SMs). `files/qsa_gb10/` adds a bind-mounted `ops/qsa.py` that reads the
launch profile from `VLLM_QSA_PROFILE` / `VLLM_QSA_PROFILE_JSON`, a conservative 48-SM table
(`QSA_PROFILE=gb10`), and `bench_qsa_kernels.py`, which sweeps block/split/warp configs on the
real kernels with this deployment's decode shapes and writes the best table as JSON:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --ipc host \
  -v $PWD/files/qsa_gb10/qsa.py:/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/vllm/models/qwen3_8_flash_next/nvidia/ops/qsa.py:ro \
  -v $PWD/files/qsa_gb10:/work -v $HOME/.cache/vllm:/root/.cache/vllm \
  --entrypoint python3 vllm/vllm-openai:qwen38-flash-next /work/bench_qsa_kernels.py --tp 2 --out /root/.cache/vllm/qsa_gb10.json
# .env: QSA_PROFILE=$HOME/.cache/vllm/qsa_gb10.json
```

`stock` (default) leaves the image untouched. The `gb10` table is a starting point, not a result.

## The PLE Patch

The NVFP4 checkpoint stores the 51B-param N-gram/PLE embedding table as FP8 shards + one global
`weight_scale`, but declares `*.ple.*` excluded in the ModelOpt-NVFP4 quant config. vLLM's PLE
resolver only enables FP8-PLE when the *whole* checkpoint is FP8-serialized, so it builds a BF16
embedding (≈102 GB) and crashes.

The fix: a resolver shim installed in `ple_layer.py` — when `PLE_QUANT_OVERRIDE=fp8` is set, the
quant-method lookup for the PLE embedding short-circuits to the image's own
`Qwen3_8FlashNextPLEFp8EmbeddingMethod` (which handles exactly this "FP8 shards + one global
weight_scale" layout), bypassing the FP8-checkpoint and `ignored_layers` checks. Applied at
runtime via bind-mount; no image rebuild needed. `start.sh` extracts and patches automatically;
delete `files/ple_layer_patched.py` to force re-extraction after an image update.

## The MXFP8 Kernel-Fallback Patch

On GB10 the MXFP8 linear layers run through `FlashInferCutlassMxfp8LinearKernel`, whose
`mm_mxfp8` only accepts weights with **N ≥ 128, N % 32 == 0, K ≥ 128, K % 32 == 0**
(measured on sm_121 against `vllm/vllm-openai:qwen38-flash-next`; the limits do not depend on
the token count). Two shapes in this checkpoint miss that:

| Layer | `[N, K]` | Why it fails |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| `language_model.layers.*.linear_attn.in_proj_a` / `in_proj_b` (×72) | `[48, 2560]` | `N < 128` → `AssertionError: mm_mxfp8 requires N >= 128, got N=48` |
| `visual.blocks.*.mlp.linear_fc1` (×27) | `[4304, 1152]` | `4304 % 32 == 16` → `ValueError: Problem size is not supported for mm_mxfp8` |

The first one is fatal at engine start — it fires on the very first forward pass, during the
`determine_available_memory()` profile run, ~7 minutes into the launch and after the weights are
already resident.

The fix: `files/patch_modelopt_mxfp8.py` rewrites `ModelOptMxFp8LinearMethod.create_weights` to
check the *post-TP-split* `(N, K)` it is about to hand the kernel and swap in
`EmulationMxfp8LinearKernel` when the native GEMM cannot take them. Emulation dequantizes MXFP8 →
BF16 once at load time, so those layers then run as plain BF16 linears (≈17 MB extra across all
72 `in_proj_a/b`). Each layer gets its own quant-method instance, so the downgrade is per-layer —
everything else keeps the native kernel. The fallback logs one line per distinct shape:

```
WARNING [modelopt.py] MXFP8 layer [N=48, K=2560] is not supported by
FlashInferCutlassMxfp8LinearKernel (needs N,K >= 128 and divisible by 32);
falling back to BF16 emulation for this shape.
```

On top of the shape check, **all** `visual.*` MXFP8 layers are routed to emulation by prefix.
That is the verified multimodal configuration; emulating only `visual.*` (rather than the whole
model) is also what keeps the load-time BF16 dequant from OOMing the GPU.

Applied at runtime via bind-mount on both nodes; no image rebuild. Delete
`files/modelopt_patched.py.orig` to force re-extraction after an image update.

## Multimodal

The model supports **Text, Image, and Video** input. vLLM auto-detects multimodal capabilities
from the config — no extra flags needed. Caveat: the MTP drafter logs
`Draft model … does not support external multimodal embeddings`, so image/video prompts draft
from text-only inputs (lower acceptance rate on those requests).

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"What is in this image?"},{"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"https://example.com/image.jpg"}}]}]}'
```

> **Verified live on this deployment** — fine OCR (48 px text inside a 3840×2160 frame,
> ≈8.2k vision tokens), color/shape/scene QA, and correct *refusal* to read text that isn't
> in the image. Two caveats: **(1)** this is a reasoning model and thinking consumes
> `max_tokens` first — if `content` is empty with `finish_reason: "length"`, just raise
> `max_tokens` (2–4k covers most image QA); `chat_template_kwargs.thinking_budget` is
> **not** honored by this build. **(2)** media must be a URL or base64 data-URL (no local
> paths — `--allowed-local-media-path` is not set), default limit is 1 image + 1 video per
> prompt, and the vision encoder budget is 16,384 tokens (larger inputs are auto-resized /
> sparse-sampled for video).

## Chat-template kwargs

Two kwargs the checkpoint's `chat_template.jinja` reads, neither of them obvious from the
config. Pass both under `chat_template_kwargs`:

**`reasoning_effort`** — `low` | `medium` | `xhigh`, default `xhigh`. Anything else is
rejected while the template renders, so the request fails with HTTP 400 before it reaches
the engine:

```
Unexpected reasoning effort max. Supported types are xhigh (default), medium, and low.
```

`high` and `max` are both **not** accepted. Worth knowing if you share one client config
with models where they are valid — that is how we found it.

**`enable_thinking`** — default `true`; `false` prefills an empty `<think></think>` block
for a non-thinking turn. Note the interaction with the above: the `reasoning_effort` check
sits *inside* the thinking branch of the template, so with `enable_thinking: false` an
invalid `reasoning_effort` is silently ignored instead of rejected. The same client config
400s in thinking mode and passes here.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}],"max_tokens":2048,"chat_template_kwargs":{"reasoning_effort":"low"}}'
```

See [Multimodal](#multimodal) for the two adjacent facts that thinking consumes
`max_tokens` and that `thinking_budget` is not honored by this build.

## Checkpoint: nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4

133 GB / 11 shards: BF16 dense (attention, GDN, hyper-connections, shared experts,
vision, lm_head) + NVFP4 routed experts + a 51 GB FP8 per-tensor PLE table.
Measured on this 2-Spark kit at `MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144`, `GMU=0.835`:

| | value |
|---|---|
| Weights resident | 62.72 GiB / node (66.14 GiB incl. non-torch) |
| KV cache (fp8, default) | 32.02 GiB — **3,652,200 tokens**, 13.93× at 262K |
| Peak activation / CUDA graphs | 2.15 GiB / 0.4 GiB |
| Load time | ~6:15 weights, 122 s engine init |
| Decode (batch-1, greedy) | ~24.5 tok/s |

vLLM reports headroom for `--kv-cache-memory=44208844800` (41.17 GiB) if you want
to push `GMU` up. At 2.66M cache tokens a 1M-token context still fits ~2.6×.

Two checkpoint-specific fixes are applied automatically by `start.sh`; both exist
because this checkpoint records metadata differently from `local-inference-lab/…`:

1. **PLE table dtype** (`files/detect_ple_dtype.py`) — the FP8 PLE table is declared
   only in `quantization_config.config_groups`, not as `text_config.ple_embedding_dtype`
   which the patched `ple_layer.py` dispatches on. Recovered and re-injected via
   `--hf-overrides`. Without it the 51 GB FP8 PLE table fails to load.
2. **MTP layer-index alias** (`files/patch_checkpoint_config.py`) — vLLM builds the MTP
   draft layer at the absolute index `mtp.layers.48`, and matches quantization metadata
   by exact string. This checkpoint records only `mtp.layers.0`. The alias is added in
   **both** `config.json` and the legacy `hf_quant_config.json` (vLLM reads the legacy
   file on the draft-model path) and bind-mounted in; the HF cache is never modified.

3. **FP8_BLOCK_SCALES routed experts** (`files/patch_modelopt_fp8_block_moe.py`) — this
   checkpoint's MTP routed experts are 128x128 block-scaled FP8, but
   `ModelOptMixedPrecisionConfig.get_quant_method` builds `RoutedExperts` only for
   `FP8` / `NVFP4` / `W4A16_NVFP4` / `MXFP8`. Anything else returns `None`, giving a
   silently *unquantized* MoE that dies ~7 min into the load with
   `Layer mtp.layers.48.mlp.experts has no parameter 'w2_weight_scale_inv'`.
   The patch adds the missing branch, routing to vLLM's own `Fp8MoEMethod` with
   `weight_block_size` read from the checkpoint's `group_size` (it refuses to guess —
   a wrong block shape applies misaligned scales silently rather than failing).

> **This gap is not specific to this image.** Upstream vLLM has no `FP8_BLOCK_SCALES`
> branch either — not at commit `d4d703ca` (which the model card recommends, and which
> only fixes FP8 PLE loading, #54882), nor on current `main`. Upgrading vLLM does not
> enable MTP here. `start.sh` preflights the MTP expert algo and fails in seconds if it
> ever sees one the dispatch cannot build.

### MTP measured on this kit (TP2+EP, MTP=3, 262144 ctx, GMU 0.835)

| | MTP off | MTP=3 |
|---|---|---|
| Decode (batch-1, greedy) | 24.5 tok/s | **52.1 tok/s (2.13x)** |
| Draft acceptance | — | **72.8%** (823/1131) |
| Acceptance by position | — | 89% / 74.5% / 60% |
| Weights resident | 62.72 GiB | 64.3 GiB |
| KV cache (bf16) | 2,663,445 tok (10.16x) | 2,131,159 tok (8.13x) |
| KV cache (fp8, default) | — | **3,652,200 tok (13.93x)** |

The decaying per-position acceptance curve is the check that matters: a wrong block
shape would show up as near-random acceptance, not as a crash.

Concurrency and prefill numbers for this configuration are in
[Performance](#performance-nvidiaqwen38-flash-next-nvfp4-tp2ep-mtp3-262144-ctx-gmu-0835).

## Reduced-vocabulary MTP drafting

**Off by default** — set `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` to a token-id list to enable it.

This checkpoint's vocabulary is **248,320 tokens**, and the MTP drafter carries its *own* BF16
`ParallelLMHead` over all of it (`tie_word_embeddings` is false): 248320 × 2560 × 2 B = **1.18 GiB,
0.59 GiB per GPU at TP=2**, read once per draft step. At MTP=3 that is three of the four lm_head
reads in an engine step — roughly a quarter of the ~9.2 GiB a single-stream step moves per GPU.
Slicing that head down for drafting is the largest single bandwidth lever in the decode step.

**It cannot change what the server emits.** Draft sampling is greedy and every draft is verified
against the target model, so a token outside the subset is simply rejected, exactly like any other
bad draft. The cost is acceptance, not correctness.

```bash
python3 bench/gen_draft_corpus.py --out corpus.jsonl          # the model's own output
python3 files/build_draft_vocab.py corpus.jsonl \
        --out draft_vocab.txt --size 65536 --fill-to-size --balance-shards 2
MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB=$PWD/draft_vocab.txt ./start.sh --launch
```

`start.sh` then patches `nvidia/mtp.py` (step 4e) and sets `use_local_argmax_reduction`, which is
the only path that reaches the reduced head — `compute_logits` keeps the full vocabulary.

**Balance the vocabulary across TP ranks.** A vocab-parallel lm_head splits by *id range*, and a
decode step waits for the slowest rank. Filling with the lowest-numbered ids put 65,392 of 65,536
on rank 0, so only one rank saved anything; `--balance-shards 2` splits them 32,768/32,768:

| draft vocab | draft head per rank | decode: prose / code / entropy / copy | acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| full 248,320 (default) | 0.59 GiB | 40.0 / 43.2 / 40.1 / **59.1** | **56.5%** |
| 65,536, lowest-id fill | 0.31 GiB | 40.3 / 44.1 / 42.3 / 65.0 | 53.2% |
| 65,536, `--balance-shards 2` | **0.16 GiB** | **42.5 / 44.5 / 45.4** / 56.5 | 47.8% |

*(bf16 KV, 400 decoded tokens at 1k context, greedy, `bench/decodebench.py`; acceptance as a delta
via `bench/mtp_accept.py`.)*

**Read this honestly: it is a real trade, not a free win.** Balancing helps prose, code and
entropy, but acceptance falls 56.5% → 47.8% and the `copy` task — the one that leans hardest on
the drafter predicting quoted text — ends up *below* the full-vocabulary baseline. Bandwidth and
acceptance pull in opposite directions.

**The vocabulary above is mostly padding, and that is the likely culprit.** The corpus behind it
was 85 documents / 49,141 token occurrences, which yielded only **8,305 distinct ids** — coverage
saturates by 16,384, so `--fill-to-size` padded the rest with the lowest-numbered unseen ids on the
theory that byte-level BPE is built in merge order. That is a *proxy, not a measurement*. Two
things worth trying before judging the lever: a much larger corpus so 65k can be ranked honestly,
and the corpus-only ~8.3k vocabulary, which would cut the draft head to ~0.02 GiB per rank.
`build_draft_vocab.py --report-only` prints coverage at several sizes; tune on coverage, not size.

`files/test_draft_vocab.py` checks the shard slicing and the cross-rank reduction against a
full-vocabulary argmax restricted to the draft set — run it after touching the patch.

## YaRN (1M context)

```bash
# .env
MAX_MODEL_LEN=1000000
YARN_ENABLE=true
YARN_FACTOR=4.0
VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1
```

`max_position_embeddings` is 262144, so vLLM logs a `VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN must be used
with extreme caution` warning — YaRN is what makes the 1M positions valid. Quality at 1M with
`factor 4.0` is beyond the checkpoint's trained range: benchmark before trusting long-context
answers, and fall back to `MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144` / `YARN_ENABLE=false` for comparison runs.

> **Rule:** YaRN exists to *extend* context beyond native. At `MAX_MODEL_LEN` ≤ 262144 it has no
> benefit and costs accuracy, so `start.sh` now force-disables it automatically (prints a NOTE) —
> no need to remember `YARN_ENABLE=false` when testing at native context.

> **Fixed Sep 2026 — YaRN was previously a silent no-op.** `start.sh` emitted
> `--hf-overrides '{"rope_parameters":{...}}'` at the *top level*. vLLM's
> `ModelConfig._apply_dict_overrides` only recurses into keys that are themselves nested configs;
> for `qwen4_exp` the parent config exposes `rope_parameters` as a plain dict, so the override was
> `setattr`'d onto the parent and never reached `text_config`, which the model actually reads.

## Performance (nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4, TP2+EP, MTP=3, 262144 ctx, GMU 0.835)

Measured with [**sparkDash**](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash) against the running server.
Configuration at capture: **fp8 KV** (the shipped default) **plus the 65,536-id balanced MTP draft
vocabulary** — the draft vocab is *not* a default, it was passed via `MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB` (see
[Reduced-vocabulary MTP drafting](#reduced-vocabulary-mtp-drafting)). Drop that and expect the
decode column to move; the prefill column should not.

### Decode — prose, concurrency sweep

| Concurrency | Aggregate | Per stream | TTFT |
|---|---|---|---|
| ×1 | 54.4 tok/s | **54.4 tok/s** | 160 ms |
| ×2 | 86.5 tok/s | 45.1 tok/s | 426 ms |
| ×4 | 128.1 tok/s | 34.2 tok/s | 471 ms |
| ×6 | 169.7 tok/s | 29.7 tok/s | 490 ms |
| ×8 | **207.0 tok/s** | 26.7 tok/s | 432 ms |

Aggregate scales 3.8× from ×1 to ×8 while per-stream falls to 49%. Batch-1 decode is bound by
**weight** bandwidth, so extra streams ride the same weight fetch nearly for free at first, and the
per-stream cost only starts to bite once the batch itself fills the step. (Speculative decoding
normally contributes to that decay — drafts compete with real tokens for the step budget — but
acceptance was not measured per concurrency level here, so treat the split as unattributed.)

### Prefill

| Prompt | Tokens | Throughput | TTFT |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8k | 8,230 | 2874.9 tok/s | 2.86 s |
| 16k | 16,423 | 2962.1 tok/s | 5.54 s |
| 32k | 32,806 | **2962.2 tok/s** | 11.08 s |
| 64k | 65,575 | 2893.4 tok/s | 22.66 s |
| 128k | 131,109 | 2727.1 tok/s | 48.08 s |

Prefill is flat at ~2.96k tok/s from 16k to 64k and sheds 8% by 128k — QSA keeps attention from
dominating at long context, so TTFT stays close to linear in prompt length.

### Against the previous bf16-KV, full-vocabulary run

Same kit, same checkpoint, same GMU. Both changes (fp8 KV, reduced draft vocab) are folded in, so
the deltas are not individually attributable — the per-lever measurements are in
[FP8 KV](#kv-cache-budget) and [draft vocab](#reduced-vocabulary-mtp-drafting).

| | before | now | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| decode ×1 | 52.1 tok/s | **54.4** | +4.4% |
| decode ×2 | 83.3 | **86.5** | +3.8% |
| decode ×4 | **136.5** | 128.1 | −6.2% |
| decode ×6 | **170.7** | 169.7 | −0.6% |
| decode ×8 | **210.1** | 207.0 | −1.5% |
| TTFT ×1 | 236 ms | **160 ms** | −32% |
| prefill 32k | 2933.3 tok/s | **2962.2** | +1.0% |
| prefill 128k | 2697.1 tok/s | **2727.1** | +1.1% |
| KV cache | 2,131,159 tok | **3,652,200** | +71% |

Low concurrency and TTFT improved; mid-range concurrency (×4) regressed. Prefill is essentially
unchanged, which is the expected shape — these levers act on the decode step and the cache, not
on prefill compute.

Re-measure after changing `MAX_MODEL_LEN`, `MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS`, `KV_CACHE_DTYPE`,
`MTP_DRAFT_VOCAB`, `FP8_DENSE` or `QSA_PROFILE`. Each decode step streams ≈9 GiB per GPU (lm_head
×4 because of the three MTP draft passes, routed experts, GDN projections, replicated bf16
HyperConnection); a reduced draft vocabulary is a direct cut into three of those four lm_head
reads. See `docs/CLAUDE/fable5-1-report.md` §2 for the byte model and `FP8_DENSE` below for
another lever.

## Gotchas

- **`PLE_OFFLOAD=true` needs ~51 GB of free CPU RAM.** The launch log reported
  `Available RAM: 44.92 GiB` at target-weight load and `41.71 GiB` before the MTP drafter
  loads on this box — offloading will OOM or thrash swap. Keep it `false`
  here; the FP8 PLE shard fits comfortably on the GPU.
- **Drop page caches before every launch** if you hit a `CUDA out of memory` that
  "worked yesterday" on unified memory: `sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`
  on **both** nodes. `start.sh` does **not** do this for you (it needs no root).
- **Never point `IB_HCA` at an HCA cabled to another cluster** — NCCL will hang mid-NCCL-init
  with no useful error. One exact-match device per node (leading `=`).
- **`IB_GID_INDEX=3` does not come up on every ConnectX/RoCE setup.** If NCCL/RoCE fails
  to initialise, try `IB_GID_INDEX=5` (some clusters route on GID 5 instead).
- **Cross-wired nodes**: head uses `f1`, worker `f0` — hence the separate `WORKER_IFACE` /
  `WORKER_IB_HCA` overrides. If you re-cable, set both.
- **fp8 KV needs the QSA patch, which `start.sh` applies for you.** The stock kernels declare
  `supported_kv_cache_dtypes = ["auto", "bfloat16"]`; passing `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` to an
  unpatched image raises `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next QSA requires a BF16 main KV cache`. Do not hand-roll
  the flag — set `KV_CACHE_DTYPE` in `.env` so the patch is applied with it.
- **`.env` beats the environment**, except `ABLIT` and `HF_TOKEN`. `start.sh` sources `.env`
  after reading the environment, so `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8 ./start.sh` is silently ignored for
  any key that `.env` already defines. Edit `.env`, or check the `KV dtype:` line in the
  launch summary. `ABLIT=1 ./start.sh` and `HF_TOKEN=hf_... ./download.sh` **do** win over
  `.env`, matching the single-Spark 0/1 flag.
- **MTP >1 token** logs `running multiple times of forward on same MTP layer, which may result
  in lower acceptance rate`, and the QSA backend can't fuse multi-step draft decode (it rebuilds
  attention metadata per draft step). `MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS=1` is the safe comparison point.
- `./stop.sh` force-removes `vllm-fn` on both nodes. If the NFS share is in use it stays up
  so the next `--launch` does not rebuild it; `./stop.sh --nfs` tears it down too.
  FlashInfer autotune cache in `~/.cache/vllm` is the only per-node state that carries over.
- **`NFS_SHARE=true` only:** do not stop `vllm-fn-nfs` while vLLM is loading or running — the
  worker reads shards from it. Cold start streams ~126 GiB over CX7 (lazy safetensors); once
  weights are in GPU memory the share is idle.
- **Weights corruption is silent until load.** A shard corrupted mid-download keeps its
  apparent size close enough that `check-weights.sh` (size + file count) passes, then the
  engine dies at ~33% weight load with `safe_open` → "incomplete metadata, file not fully
  covered". Run `./check-weights.sh --verify` after any download or rsync to hash every
  shard against the Hugging Face manifest (read-only; ~1 min for 135 GB at the 2.4 GiB/s
  8-thread hash rate measured on local NVMe, proportionally slower over NFS). If the nodes
  are busy, `./check-weights.sh --dry-run` does the same planning and presence/size checks
  without reading the weights.
- **No route to `huggingface.co` from the nodes?** `--verify` needs the file manifest, not
  the weights. Save it once where the API is reachable and pass it in — nothing else phones
  home, and the same file is shipped to the worker:

  ```bash
  python3 verify-weights.py --repo RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 \
      --save-manifest manifest.json --fetch-only     # where the API is reachable
  ./check-weights.sh --manifest manifest.json        # on the head node
  ```

  `HF_API_BASE` in `.env` points the fetch at a mirror instead.
- **No route to Docker Hub from the nodes?** `start.sh` runs `docker pull` on head and
  worker, so both need to reach the registry. If only one node can, pull there and ship the
  image over SSH — `docker save "$IMAGE" | ssh worker docker load`. If neither can, fetch it
  from a host that can (`crane pull "$IMAGE" image.tar`, HTTP proxy if needed) and
  `docker load < image.tar` on both nodes before running `./start.sh --launch`.
- **`huggingface_hub >= 1.x` offline mode fails with "Cannot find cached snapshot"** if
  `refs/main` has a trailing newline. Write `refs/main` with `printf`, not `echo`.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `download.sh` | fetch weights onto the **head** (`ABLIT=1` for the gated Keys house snapshot — requires `HF_TOKEN` and accepted Hugging Face terms; `--fp8` for official FP8); `start.sh` handles the worker |
| `start.sh` | optional download on head → distribute to worker (rsync, or NFS with `--nfs`) → verify complete snapshot → image sync → PLE + MXFP8 patches → launch rank 1 then rank 0. `ABLIT=1` selects the Keys house checkpoint |
| `start-fp8.sh` | optional official FP8 path (`Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8`); native 262K, no YaRN; **~500k KV cache tokens** on this kit |
| `stop.sh` | `docker rm -f vllm-fn` on worker, then head (`--nfs` also stops the share) |
| `check-weights.sh` | verify the checkpoint on the head and on the worker (local copy, or over NFS when `NFS_SHARE=true`) |
| `check-weights.sh --verify` | per-file SHA-256 verification against the Hugging Face manifest (~1 min read-only) |
| `check-weights.sh --dry-run` | plan `--verify` (fetch manifest, check presence/size) without hashing or scp |
| `check-weights.sh --dry-run` | plan `--verify` (fetch manifest, check presence/size) without hashing or scp |
| `check-weights.sh --manifest FILE` | verify against a manifest saved earlier — no Hugging Face API call |
| `verify-weights.py` | per-file SHA-256 verification against the Hugging Face manifest (used by `check-weights.sh --verify`) |
