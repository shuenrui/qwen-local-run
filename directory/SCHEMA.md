# Directory data model

One entry = **one runnable setup**: a specific model, a specific checkpoint
variation, a specific engine configuration, on specific hardware. That is the
unit that actually gets measured and actually gets run, so it is the unit the
directory stores.

A model with 8 checkpoints across 3 engines is 24 setups, not 1 row. They share
a `model` id and a `variation.checkpoint`, which is how the site groups them.

```
data/

```

Everything is validated by `validate.py`. Unknown ids and missing required
fields fail the build rather than silently rendering as blank.

## models/<id>.json

Model records hold architecture, context, modalities, publisher facts, and the
homepage's curated practical baseline. The baseline is a reference to one exact
setup; it never duplicates memory or performance numbers.

```jsonc
"practical_baseline": {
  "status": "selected",                    // selected | not_verified
  "setup": "qwen38-...-4090-hybrid",       // -> data/setups/, same model
  "rationale": "Why this is the most accessible stable 4-bit-or-better lane",
  "reviewed": "2026-09-12"
}
```

`selected` requires a `reported` or `measured` setup, a stable 4-bit-or-better
quantization, and reproducible run instructions. The selected setup's hardware,
requirements, engine, context, capabilities, caveats, measurements, and sources
remain the sole source of every value shown on the homepage.

When no setup qualifies, record the gap rather than estimating:

```jsonc
"practical_baseline": {
  "status": "not_verified",
  "setup": null,
  "reason": "No reported or measured stable 4-bit-or-better run is currently recorded.",
  "reviewed": "2026-09-12"
}
```

The selection policy prioritizes accessible hardware: a single consumer GPU or
commonly available Mac, then a consumer GPU with host-RAM offload, then a 128 GB
workstation/appliance, then a custom multi-GPU rig. RAM and SSD streaming are
allowed only when their full requirement is recorded and displayed prominently.
Speed appears only if the selected setup itself has a representative
single-stream decode measurement.

## Provenance

The single most important rule in this dataset. Every number carries a
`provenance` field, and the site never mixes tiers:

| Tag      | Meaning                                    | Trust |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| `box`    | Measured on our own hardware, method stated | high  |
| `forum`  | Reported by a community builder, linked     | mid   |
| `vendor` | Claimed by the publisher of the artifact    | low   |

`box` numbers must have `date`, `n`, and `method`. `forum` numbers must have
`source` (a URL to the thread or repo). `vendor` numbers must have `source`
(the model card or announcement). A number with no source is a validation
error — the fix is to delete it, not to downgrade the rule.

```

`run.steps` is an array of objects with exactly two fields: `kind` and `text`.
Use `kind: "cmd"` only when `text` is a shell command that can be run as shown;
use `kind: "do"` for prose instructions, UI actions, placeholders, or commands
that still need the reader to supply or interpret details. `kind` must be `cmd`
or `do`, and `text` must be a non-empty string. Legacy string entries are not
valid.

### metric enum

Speed and quality are kept in separate namespaces so the site can chart them
without mixing units.

- Speed: `decode_code`, `decode_essay`, `decode_chat`, `decode_agg`,
  `decode_per_stream`, `prefill_tok_s`, `ttft_ms`, `task_time_min`
- Quality: `quality_index`, `bench_code`, `bench_toolcall`, `bench_mmlu`
- Footprint: `memory_gb`, `disk_gb`

Anything not in the enum must be added to `validate.py` first. That friction is
deliberate: it stops the dataset from drifting into fifty one-off metric names
that cannot be compared.

`decode_agg` is reserved for throughput summed across simultaneous streams and
therefore requires `concurrency > 1`. A mean across sequential prompts or task
categories is `decode_per_stream` with `concurrency: 1` and `stat: "mean"`.
Use the optional `stat` field when a source distinguishes `mean`, `median`, or
`peak`; headline selection prefers a non-peak value when both are available.

Speed measurements may include `concurrency`, a positive integer recording the
number of simultaneous streams or clients used for that measurement. Leave it
unset when the source does not explicitly state measurement concurrency; do not
derive it from request counts, prompt counts, capacity claims, or config names.
`decode_agg` is total decode throughput across those parallel streams, while
`prefill_tok_s` is prompt-processing/read throughput and is not decode speed.

## Schema version 2 — Phase A foundation (added 2026-09-16)

`schema_version: 2` is optional and additive. Legacy setup records remain valid
without it, and Phase A does not migrate pilot evidence. The authoritative
design document is `docs/EVIDENCE-SCHEMA-2026-09-16.md`; this file records the
implemented directory-side contract.

### Measurement IDs and the lone-ID exemption

Phase A assigned a stable local `id` to every existing measurement:

```jsonc
"measurements": [
  {
    "id": "m001",
    "metric": "decode_per_stream",
    "value": 90.0,
    "unit": "tok/s"
  }
]
```

- IDs are local to one setup, match `validate.py`'s `ID_RE`, and must be unique
  within that setup.
- The initial IDs are mechanical `m001`, `m002`, ... values assigned from the
  current measurement order by `tools/assign_measurement_ids.py`. They are
  identity metadata for later evidence links; they do not reorder, edit, or
  reinterpret any existing measurement.
- **A lone `measurements[].id` does NOT trigger `schema_version: 2`.** The
  exemption exists so all 190 legacy measurements can gain stable references
  without changing their prose, values, or evidence status.
- Any other schema-v2 block — `measurements[].conditions`,
  `measurements[].evidence`, setup-level `evidence`, `interconnect`, `serving`,
  `correctness`, `known_failures`, or `capability_observations` — requires
  `schema_version: 2`.

### Canonical technique registry

Technique identity lives in `data/techniques/<id>.json`, one packet per
technique. Task #16 chose the per-file directory form rather than the proposal
document's single `data/techniques.json` file because it matches the existing
`data/<collection>/<id>.json` pattern used by models, hardware, engines, and
setups.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "native-mtp",
  "name": "llama.cpp native MTP",
  "category": "speculative_decode",
  "canonical_description": "Uses the target model’s multi-token-prediction path rather than a separate block-diffusion drafter.",
  "mechanism": "...",
  "constraints": ["..."],
  "tradeoffs": ["..."],
  "re_review_triggers": ["..."],
  "canonical_sources": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/27950",
      "kind": "thread",
      "archive_path": "directory/tools/history/inputs/pass4-social/raw/gh-discussion_ggml-org_llama.cpp_27950.json",
      "locator": "title, body, and comments",
      "note": "Durable source-backed provenance for the canonical packet."
    }
  ],
  "status": "proposed",
  "updated": "2026-09-16"
}
```

Rules:

- `validate.py` validates the registry and rejects any unknown `technique_id`
  referenced from a schema-v2 claim.
- `check_links.py` fetches technique `canonical_sources[].url` values. Each
  source may alternatively cite a durable `archive_path`; at least one of
  `url` or `archive_path` is required.
- A packet supplies canonical technique identity only. It may not create a
  setup-specific causal, fit, quality, performance, or reproduction claim by
  itself.
- Phase A does not modify `build.py` or `site_src/`, so the technique registry
  is not yet inlined into the generated site payload. It is currently a
  validator/link-checked data collection. A later build/UI phase can expose it
  through the existing `build.py` collection pattern.

### Derived evidence properties

The validator derives display-only properties; it never writes them back into
`data/` and never auto-populates missing facts:

- `condition_completeness` for measurements and comparisons is derived from the
  recorded conditions/method/source fields. A stored `condition_completeness`
  value is a validation error.
- `wall_clock_division` measurements require a method note. They remain visible
  as C2 observations, but the validator/build-visible derived flags mark them
  `headline_eligible: false` and `comparability_eligible: false`.
- Quality status is separate from causal evidence level. There is no C5 level,
  and quality status never upgrades evidence level.

## device specs (hardware records, added 2026-09-10)

Hardware records carry an optional `device` block (contract:
`data/device-schema.json`; enforced by `validate.py`). It holds the specs that
actually determine local-inference performance — bandwidth sets the decode
roofline, capacity sets what fits — so readers can see why the same model
scores differently across classes. Provenance law applies: every published
figure in a device block traces to `device.sources[]`.

```jsonc
"device": {
  "identity": {"name": "NVIDIA DGX Spark", "chip": "GB10 Grace Blackwell",
               "manufacturer": "NVIDIA", "os": "DGX OS (Ubuntu)",
               "form_factor": "desktop", "sku": null},
  "memory":   {"total_gb": 128, "type": "LPDDR5X", "bandwidth_gbs": 273,
               "interface_bits": 256, "channels": null,   // only when published
               "unified": true, "usable_gb": 119, "note": null},
  "compute":  {"cpu_cores": "20-core Arm: 10x Cortex-X925 + 10x Cortex-A725",
               // every figure null unless the vendor publishes it:
               "fp32_tflops": null, "fp16_dense_tflops": null,
               "fp16_sparse_tflops": null, "fp8_dense_tflops": null,
               "fp8_sparse_tflops": null, "fp4_sparse_pflops": 1.0,
               "tensor_ai_tops": null, "neural_engine_tops": null,
               "note": "which figures are published, and what they mean"},
  "storage":  {"type": "NVMe M.2", "capacity_gb": 4096, "read_gbs": null},
  "thermal":  {"tdp_watts": 140, "psu_watts": 240, "cooling": "active fan"},
  "variants": [ // class records only: the exact SKUs, each verified
    {"id": "rtx-3090", "name": "GeForce RTX 3090", "chip": "GA102 (Ampere)",
     "memory_configs": "24 GB GDDR6X, 384-bit", "bandwidth_gbs": 936,
     "fp32_tflops": 35.6, "tdp_watts": 350}
  ],
  "sources": [{"url": "https://www.nvidia.com/...", "note": "which figures this backs"}]
}
```

Rules:

- **Placement.** The block lives in `data/hardware/<id>.json` — one spec per
  hardware class/SKU, never duplicated per setup. A setup may carry its own
  `device` key only as a measurement-specific override (same shape, no record
  cross-checks).
- **Class vs SKU.** Class records (with `bandwidth_range_gbs`) may set
  `memory.bandwidth_gbs: null` and enumerate `variants` instead; each variant
  bandwidth must fall inside the class range. Exact-SKU records must match
  their record's top-level `bandwidth_gbs` exactly.
- **null means unpublished.** A vendor figure that is not published stays
  `null` with a note — third-party estimates do not enter the dataset. Apple
  publishes Neural Engine TOPS but no GPU FLOPS; NVIDIA publishes FP4-sparse
  peaks for GB10 but no dense rates. Say what is missing, never a guess.
- **`memory.unified`** must be `true` for Apple records (CPU and GPU share one
  pool); `false` for discrete VRAM.
- **Backward compatible.** A hardware record without `device` passes with a
  warning naming the gap; setups without device specs are unaffected.

## Adding an entry

1. Copy `data/setups/_template.json`.
2. Fill every field you can verify. Use `null` for unknown — never a guess.
3. Every measurement gets a `source` unless `provenance` is `box`.
4. From the repository root, run `python3 directory/check.sh`. It validates the
   data, fetches every source URL, rebuilds `site/index.html`, and runs the
   browser suite. Every stage must pass.

## Conventions (added 2026-09-06, hygiene pass)

- **Source kinds** (`sources[].kind`): `repo`, `model`, `thread`, `post`,
  `video`, `docs`, `paper`, `blog`, `benchmark`, `other`. Forum threads and
  discussion tabs are `thread`; a builder's raw README is `docs`.
- **Licenses**: `variation.license` records the *weights'* license in SPDX
  display form (e.g. `Apache-2.0`). Where a builder repo or runtime carries
  different terms (Mia's AGPL scripts, a card tagged `other`), the weights
  license still goes in the field and the difference goes in `caveats`.
  A null license is a validation-era mistake: derive it from the base family
  and say so in a caveat.
- **Sizes**: `variation.size_gb` comes from the HuggingFace *tree* endpoint
  (`/api/models/<id>/tree/main?recursive=true`), summing safetensors shards or
  picking the GGUF/MLX file that matches the quant tier. The siblings endpoint
  returns 0 for LFS files and must not be used. A size of 0 or null is invalid.
- **Checkpoint ids** stay clean (`org/repo`); quant flavour parentheticals
  belong in `quant_detail`, never in `checkpoint`.
- **Context**: `models[].context.native` null means "the publisher did not
  state it", which is honest and allowed; the site renders it as unstated
  rather than blank-zero.
- **Identity**: two setups may share checkpoint + engine + hardware when their
  engine `config` differs (different spec-decode, runtime, or memory profile).
  The config string is part of a setup's identity; the validator's duplicate
  check includes it.
- **Multi-unit hardware**: a setup on more than one identical unit writes the
  hardware reference as an object — `[{"id": "dgx-spark", "count": 2}]` — rather
  than inventing a `dgx-spark-2x` class. `count` is a positive integer and
  defaults to 1 for a bare id string. The count is part of identity: 1x and 2x
  of a class are different setups. The site renders it as "2× <class name>".
- **Family scope**: the model list covers Qwen 3.0/3.5/3.6/3.8 text, vision and
  omni branches that have a plausible local lane. Excluded on purpose:
  cluster-scale models (Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B, Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B), sub-4B edge
  models (no hardware class below a 24 GB GPU / 32 GB Mac), and
  Embedding/Reranker/ASR/TTS (not text-generation serving). There is no Qwen 4
  series as of the 2026-09-05 audit of the Qwen org.

## Social & archive conventions (added 2026-09-10, pass 4)

Social channels (X, YouTube, Reddit, GitHub discussions, vendor forums) are a
**discovery layer** (AGENTS law 9). A social find becomes a dataset entry only
through this ladder — the higher the rung, the more of the number survives:

1. **Names a durable artifact.** The post/video points at a GitHub repo or HF
   model card. The recipe is read from the repo (pinned via `run.repo_commit`,
   sha or tag, at fetch time) — never from the caption. Numbers stated in the
   post enter as `forum` with quote, date, method note and the post URL as an
   extra source; the artifact stays the primary source.
2. **No artifact, but fully stated.** The post gives hardware + engine config
   + command + measurement method explicitly. A `forum` number is allowed with
   the post as primary source (kind `post`/`video`/`thread`), rot-prone URLs
   archived (see below).
3. **Vaguer than that.** No number is recorded. The setup may still enter as
   `reported`/`untested` with the post as a discovery source, or not at all.

- **`sources[].mirror_url`** — required for any `reddit.com` URL (law 10):
  reddit hard-403s this environment, so the pullpush/arctic-shift mirror JSON
  is the verifiable evidence. `check_links.py` fetches the mirror and reports
  the permalink alongside it. The quote must match the mirror payload
  verbatim; the note records the fetch date.
- **Archive convention** — other rot-prone links (X posts, YouTube
  descriptions, forum posts likely to be deleted) carry an archive.today or
  web.archive.org URL in the source `note` when one exists.
- **Lineage dedupe** — N social posts about the same repo + engine + config +
  hardware collapse into one setup. The earliest or most complete post is the
  primary source; the rest are listed in `sources` as corroboration, never as
  separate rows.
- **New hardware classes** implied by social leads (Strix Halo, RDNA3 desktop,
  sub-24 GB GPUs) are an owner decision (AGENTS open decision 4); collect the
  candidate, do not create the class unilaterally.

## Maintenance tools

- `validate.py` — schema and enum enforcement; runs inside `build.py`. Use
  `--legacy-pin-warnings` in fixture/migration work to show the advisory pin
  warnings for unmigrated legacy records; the publish gate omits it so the
  live gate stays on the single known hardware warning.
- `check_links.py` — re-fetches every cited URL; exit 1 on any dead link.
  Run it before publishing: a dead source URL is a provenance failure.
- `import_bench.py` — regenerates `box` measurements from `bench/ab.py`
  results via `data/bench_map.json`; appends to `data/measurements.jsonl`.
- `verify_browser.py` — headless-Chromium behaviour checks against a served
  or live URL; dataset-size agnostic.
- `tools/vet_candidates.py` — pre-merge vetting for research-pass candidates:
  enums (imported from `validate.py`, no drift), URL liveness, duplicates,
  Scenario B prune gates (law 11), plausibility (fit + bandwidth roofline),
  lineage dedupe.
- `tools/social_candidates.py` — pass-4 collector: fetches X (fxtwitter),
  YouTube, Reddit (pullpush mirror), GitHub discussions/issues (`gh`), and
  Discourse forums (HF, NVIDIA) into
  `tools/history/inputs/pass4-social/` (raw payloads + ledger).
- `tools/coverage.py` — facet coverage tables (generation, format, quant,
  engine, hardware, provenance, status) from the current dataset, plus
  schema-v2 state, v2 evidence blocks, technique-id use, and technique count.
- `tools/assign_measurement_ids.py` — idempotent Phase A sweep that inserts
  mechanical `measurements[].id` values and proves byte/parsed equality for
  every existing field. Run `--check` first; `apply` is the only live-data
  change authorized by Phase A.
- `tools/check_schema_v2_fixtures.py` — reproducible positive/negative schema-v2
  fixture suite. It copies the dataset into temporary scratch directories and
  never mutates live `data/`.
